      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I was born in 1999 in one of the eastern territories of the Soviet Union.
        Four days later the region I was born in declared independance and became
        Republic of Uzbekistan. A few months after that the Soviet Union cracked
        apart and the economy collapsed, though I was probably too preoccupied with
        getting my first teeth to notice. Three years later my father hauled a
        garbage bag full of almost-worthless currency to bribe some local officials
        into letting him buy plane tickets for America (our refugee visas had
        arrived just days earlier). My family set foot in Brooklyn in the fall of
        1994 and has stayed put ever since.</p>

        <span class='i'>Riding into Manhattan from Brooklyn on the Q Train</span>
      </div>

      <p>I earned my B.A. from  Hunter College in Manhattan, double-majoring in
        Chemistry and German. After graduating in May 2015, I moved upstate to
        Ithaca to join my college girlfriend (now fiancée), who was just starting
        her second year at Cornell's School for Veterinary Medicine. She'll be
        graduating next May and we're both unbelievably excited to get back home
        to New York City.</p>
      <p>I moved to Ithaca without any job lined up or plan. I assumed things would
        work out, which in retrospect may have been somewhat dewy-eyed. I spent my
        first few months tutoring Chemistry to local students, but eventually landed
        an interview at the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory. The interview involved
        answering some challenge problems like "Why does it take longer to cook pasta
        at the top of Mount Everest than at sea-level?" and "Please estimate the
        blood pressure of a giraffe." I guess my answers satisfied them because
        luckily I got the job.</p>
      <h3>Art & Literature</h3>
      <p>Both my parents were artists in Russia. My mom was a painter and my dad
        was a theatre director, and I inherited their love of all things artsy.
        I always gravitated to literature, especially poetry, and I love to write in
        my spare time. Some of my favorite poets (in no particular order) are Boris
        Pasternak, Marina Tsvetaeva, Joseph Brodsky, W.H. Auden, Robert Frost,
        Wallace Stevens, Rainer Maria Rilke... In college I worked alongside one of
        my German Professors on translating some of <a href=
        "https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/rainer-maria-rilke">Rilke's</a> early,
        untranslated poetry into English. We're still at it, and hopefully we'll
        publish it once the work is complete.</p>
      <h3>Miscellaneous Extras...</h3>
      <p>One of the side-effects of my scatter-brained approach to things is that I
        wind up with too many hobbies and side-interests... So at odd intervals I
        haphazardly try to play Classical Guitar (took classes throughout college),
        practice Yoga (even got a Teaching Certificate from Dharma Yoga after
        finishing high school), study Ancient Greek, and finish a two-thousand page
        biography about the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. Wish me luck!</p>
