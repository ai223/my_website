      <h4 class='blog_titles'>How to get an image to pop up on your webpage when hovering over text</h4>
      <p>I noticed this cool trick on some webpages: when your mouse hovers over some
      word, an image appears in the background out of nowhere. The effect is surprising
      and fun. I wanted to quickly describe how to get this functionality using just
      HTML and CSS, because it's not very difficult to pull off and the return is
      pretty high. </p>
      <p>Because we want to take advantage of CSS's hover effect, we'll start by
        wrapping a portion of text with an anchor tag:</p>
      <p class='code_snippet'><code>&lt;a href='#' id='hover'&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
      <p>This creates the desired link, so we can take advantage of its hover class.
      (The <code>href='#'</code> just means the link doesn't refer to anything; "#" is just
      a conventional symbol for null - you can use whatever you want.) The id will
      allow us to referance this anchor later in CSS.</p>
      <p>Now that we have our link, we want to associate an image with it. That means
      we're going to want to add an image tag right inside of the anchor tags, just like
      this:</p>
      <p class='code_snippet'><code>&lt;a href='#' id='hover'&gt;some text&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src='filepath/image.jpg'
      alt='image' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
      <p>It's a little ugly, but the main thing is that the anchor tag now incorporates
      an image referance. The rest of the work can be done in CSS:</p>
      <p><code class='code_snippet_block'>
      #hover {<br>
        &nbsp;cursor: default;<br>
        &nbsp;position: relative;<br>
      }<br>
      <br>
      #hover div {<br>
        &nbsp;position: absolute;<br>
        &nbsp;display: none;<br>
        &nbsp;z-index: -99;<br>
      }<br>
      <br>
      #hover:hover div{<br>
        &nbsp;display: block;<br>
        &nbsp;position: absolute;<br>
      }</code></p>
      <p>You want to create three separate CSS referances as I did above. The first
      one identifies the anchor tags; note that making the position relative means
      that the image will be positioned relative to the upper-left corner of the
      inline anchor itself (i.e. the text contained inside the <code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>
      tags). Note also that I set the cursor attribute to "default." This means that
      the mouse poiter won't change form when hovering over the text. It's not
      a true link, and we don't want the pointer suggesting otherwise. </p>
      <p> The second referance is for the div container inside our anchor: it's telling
      the image to remain invisible (display: none) in its regular state (i.e. when
      there's no hovering). The large negative z-index makes sure it'll appear behind
      all other elements when it does show up.</p>
      <p>Finally we add the hovering functionality. Setting the display attribute
      "block" will have the image appear when we hover over the linked text. Use
      absolute positioning to fine-tune the picture's final location, being aware
      that it's still being moved relative to the block of text. Remember that you
      can use negative values if you want to move the image to the left of the text,
      and be careful -- if the linked text moves the image will move with it!

      <h4 class='blog_titles'>An analogy...</h4>
      <p> I began working on my first ever website today, so far only in html. The
        technical aspects have been easy and fun. I really enjoy hunting down the
        little things that are simple but make a website feel more embodied, like
        the little icon that appears in the tab title (which I made myself in
        Inkscape) or a video that magically begins playing when you open a page.
        The thing that comes harder to me is thinking about the elements of design
        rather than the code. I suspect that will be the greater challenge for me
        in taking my first web-design course. Luckily it is something I think I"ll
        come to enjoy. I've always liked thinking about user experience and ways in
        which it could be improved. Obviously that's because I am often on the end of
        less-than-steller user design like everyone else, but I also wonder if there
        isn't a parallel in literature, which I've always loved. Whenever you write
        something, before you put it out into the world, you really want to be certain
        that it's something that people are going to want to read. You don't want
        your novel or poem to be a slog to get through. Reading should be an
        enjoyable experiences, even if your real goal is plumbing the existential
        depths of Man's experience on earth. There's a reason all of Dostoevsky's
        novels are, as far as the plot's concerned, just crime dramas. A writer may
        have the most important ideas to communicate, but if the story isn't
        interesting, people aren't going to read it. This is part of a larger idea
        that an author (or director or painter or web designer or...) should always
        respect their audience. Respect them enough to make sure that their time
        spent with whatever you've made is pleasant and valuable. You'd be a jerk,
        wasting people's time, if you did any less.
