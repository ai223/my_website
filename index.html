<h2> Welcome to my webpage! </h2>

<p> I'm currently an employee at Cornell University. I work at Wilson Lab, which
houses Cornell's synchrotron, as one of the people operating it on a day-to-day
basis. That means that I am responsible for manning the <a href="ctrl_room.html"
target="_blank"> control-room</a> and making sure that the particle beams we
generate are running smoothly. Recently I've also begun taking programming courses
at Cornell (courtesy of the university's generous employee benefits) and moved
into doing some software development at work (mostly in Java). The change has
been fantastic as I continue to discover how much I enjoy programming and computer
science! </p>

<p> Feel free to check out my <a href="resume.html">résumé</a> or my (so-far-non
-existant &#x2639;) <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>. Check out the <a href=
"blog.html">Code Musings</a> page, where I'll keep a short journal recording my
experience of learning to create websites in CS1300. If you want to learn a bit
more about me, see the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> page. If you have some
interesting project, information or just want to get in touch, please go to <a
href="contact.html">Contact</a>.
