      <p><strong>This is where I'll post some of my thoughts as I learn to create
      websites in this class. It might be nice to have a record of it as the class
      goes on...</strong></p>
      <h4>03 September 2017</h4>
      <p><em>An analogy...</em></p>
      <p> I began working on my first ever website today, so far only in html. The
        technical aspects have been easy and fun. I really enjoy hunting down the
        little things that are simple but make a website feel more embodied, like
        the little icon that appears in the tab title (which I made myself in
        Inkscape) or a video that magically begins playing when you open a page.
        The thing that comes harder to me is thinking about the elements of design
        rather than the code. I suspect that will be the greater challenge for me
        in taking my first web-design course. Luckily it is something I think I"ll
        come to enjoy. I've always liked thinking about user experience and ways in
        which it could be improved. Obviously that's because I am often on the end of
        less-than-steller user design like everyone else, but I also wonder if there
        isn't a parallel in literature, which I've always loved. Whenever you write
        something, before you put it out into the world, you really want to be certain
        that it's something that people are going to want to read. You don't want
        your novel or poem to be a slog to get through. Reading should be an
        enjoyable experiences, even if your real goal is plumbing the existential
        depths of Man's experience on earth. There's a reason all of Dostoevsky's
        novels are, as far as the plot's concerned, just crime dramas. A writer may
        have the most important ideas to communicate, but if the story isn't
        interesting, people aren't going to read it. This is part of a larger idea
        that an author (or director or painter or web designer or...) should always
        respect their audience. Respect them enough to make sure that their time
        spent with whatever you've made is pleasant and valuable. You'd be a jerk,
        wasting people's time, if you did any less.
