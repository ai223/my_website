    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>

    <p>There's not much to see here yet... I've only begun learning to code this
       January, never having written a line of code in my life before. But hopefully
       I'll have more content here by the end of the Semester!</p>

    <h3>Things I'm working on...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a Java GUI at work that displays the status of various magnets,
      power-supplies and other<br>components in the particle accelerator. If
      something stops working or doesn't turn on, this program<br>could help
      determine what the problem is. It also records the trip history for each
      component, giving<br>researchers a concrete record to look back on and
      analyze.</li>
      <li>Building my own professional website, and also my first-ever website.
      Happening as I type...</li>
      <li>Learning and practicing with JavaFX, Github and other things that catch
      my scattered attention...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things I've done...</h3>
    <blockquote>Not a lot to post here just yet... </blockquote>

    <h3>Things I'd like to do...</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a calculator app for Vetarinary Medicine, letting the user
      quickly perform routine calculations<br>(like figuring out liquid dilutions).
      My fiancee, who is in her last year of vet-school at Cornell, asked<br>me to
      do it :) </li>
      <li>Create a simple game in Java, like snake. A) Becuase I loved to play
      Snake on my old Nokia phone, and<br>B) becuase I think I'll learn a lot of
      good coding techniques in the process.</li>
    </ul>
